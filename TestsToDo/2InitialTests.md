### **2. Initial List of Tests for Early MVP**

#### **File Handling Tests (`tests/test_file_handler.py`)**
1. **Test reading a LaTeX file**:
   - Ensure that the `read_latex_file` function reads a `.tex` file and returns the content as a string.
   - Test with an empty `.tex` file.
   - Test with a basic `.tex` file containing simple LaTeX commands.
   - Test with a larger `.tex` file (simulating real-world use).

2. **Test writing output to a LaTeX file**:
   - Ensure that the `write_latex_file` function writes a given string to a `.tex` file.
   - Test writing to an empty `.tex` file.
   - Test overwriting an existing file.
   - Test appending to an existing file (if applicable).

3. **Edge cases for file handling**:
   - Test handling non-existent files for reading.
   - Test writing to a non-existent directory (handle permission errors or create directories if needed).
   - Test handling of invalid file paths.

#### **Extraction Logic Tests (`tests/test_extraction.py`)**

1. **Test extracting theorems, lemmas, and propositions**:
   - Test basic extraction of a theorem environment (e.g., `\begin{theorem}...\end{theorem}`).
   - Ensure extraction works for multiple theorem-like environments in the same document.
   - Test for nested environments (e.g., theorems within proofs).

2. **Test extracting exercises and examples**:
   - Test extracting `\begin{exercise}...\end{exercise}` blocks.
   - Test extracting `\begin{example}...\end{example}` blocks.
   - Test multiple exercises and examples in the same document.

3. **Edge cases for extraction**:
   - Test for LaTeX documents with no theorems or exercises (empty extractions).
   - Test LaTeX files with malformed environments (e.g., missing `\end{theorem}`).
   - Test extraction for various LaTeX environments and custom-defined environments.

#### **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tests (`tests/test_cli.py`)**

1. **Test CLI basic functionality**:
   - Test that the CLI command runs without errors (e.g., `prepex` runs successfully).
   - Test `prepex --help` to ensure the help message displays correctly.

2. **Test CLI extraction functionality**:
   - Test that the CLI can extract theorems, lemmas, and propositions from a LaTeX file and output them.
   - Test extraction of exercises and examples via the CLI.
   - Test providing different input files and ensure correct output (e.g., `prepex input.tex`).

3. **Edge cases for CLI**:
   - Test running `prepex` with a non-existent file.
   - Test running `prepex` without any arguments (should return an error or help message).
   - Test CLI for LaTeX files with invalid syntax (how does the tool respond).

### **Prioritization**

For the MVP, you may want to focus on:
1. **Basic File Handling**: Reading and writing LaTeX files correctly is foundational, so those should definitely be tested early.
2. **Basic Extraction**: You can start with simple extractions of theorems and exercises, and more complex cases can be deferred.
3. **Basic CLI**: Make sure the CLI runs without errors and performs basic extraction, with robust error handling.
