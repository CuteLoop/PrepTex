## **Developer To-Do List (TDD Approach)**

### **1. Project Setup**

- [x] **Set up version control (Git):**
  - Initialize a Git repository.
  - Create a `.gitignore` file (ignore unnecessary files like `.pyc`, OS files, etc.).
  - Add a `README.md` with a project overview.

- [ ] **Create the repository structure:**
  - Create directories: `latex_processor/`, `tests/`, and `data/`.
  - Add `__init__.py` to the `latex_processor/` directory to make it a package.
  - Add a sample `.tex` file in `data/` for testing.
  - Create an initial `setup.py` file for dependencies.

---

### **2. Write Initial Tests (TDD)**

- [ ] **Create tests for file handling (`tests/test_file_handler.py`):**
  - Write tests for reading a LaTeX file.
  - Write tests for writing output to a LaTeX file.
  
- [ ] **Create tests for extraction logic (`tests/test_extraction.py`):**
  - Write tests to extract theorems, lemmas, and propositions.
  - Write tests to extract examples and exercises.
  
- [ ] **Create tests for the command-line interface (CLI) (`tests/test_cli.py`):**
  - Write tests to ensure the CLI can run and extract content correctly.

---

### **3. Implement Core Functionality**

- [ ] **File Handler Module (`latex_processor/file_handler.py`):**
  - Implement reading and writing LaTeX files.
  - Ensure the implementation passes the previously written tests.

- [ ] **Extraction Module (`latex_processor/extract_statements.py` & `latex_processor/extract_exercises.py`):**
  - Implement the logic for extracting theorems, propositions, and lemmas.
  - Implement the logic for extracting exercises and examples.
  - Ensure each function passes the corresponding tests.

---

### **4. Build the Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

- [ ] **Create the CLI script (`latex_processor.py`):**
  - Implement the CLI that can take LaTeX files as input and output the extracted content.
  - Ensure the CLI can handle different types of extractions (theorems vs. exercises).
  - Verify the CLI functionality using the previously written tests.

---

### **5. Documentation**

- [ ] **Update `README.md` with:**
  - Installation instructions.
  - Example commands for running the tool via the CLI.
  - Explanation of the TDD process used in the project.

---

### **6. Continuous Integration (Optional)**

- [ ] **Set up GitHub Actions (or other CI tools):**
  - Automate testing on each push or pull request using GitHub Actions.
  - Ensure the CI pipeline runs all unit tests.

---

### **7. Refactor and Improve**

- [ ] **Refactor code where needed for better readability and modularity.**
- [ ] **Enhance extraction logic (optional):**
  - Allow users to define custom LaTeX environments for extraction.
  - Explore using a LaTeX parser library for advanced processing.
